On March 19, 2020, K.K. Rebecca Lai and Keith Collins from the New York Times published an interactive article entitled,
[Which Country Has Flattened the Curve for the Coronavirus?](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/19/world/coronavirus-flatten-the-curve-countries.html). This Shiny app uses their plot design to answer the same question for states within the US.
